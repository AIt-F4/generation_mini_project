# Generation cafe app project
## Client Requirements
### completed
* create a product,courier or order and add it to a table
* view all products, couriers, or orders
* update the status of an order
* persist data in a database
* delete or update a product, order, or courier
* export entities to csv
  
### to-do

* track product inventory
* import from csv
* customer list 
* display orders by satus or courier
* unit testing with dependancy injection
* slight bug-fixing
  
## How were client requirements guaranteed?
* manual testing however no unit testing was done
* constant to-do list
* docstrings for every file, class, and function

## What would i improve
* products,couriers and orders as subclasses of a parent class as lots of code is repeated
* unit testing
* orders persisted
* use something to take all docstrings and create proper documentation
* input validation and string sanitisation 
* if we had been told to unit test at the start would have done TDD
* change ids as things are removed
## Most fun
problem solving and use of decorators
